# TarXZ-workflow
Compress/ decompress 'tar.xz' files from the context menu (macOS) 

The workflow was made using a shell script in bash.

**Features:**
*  Compress any file/ folder to 'tar.xz'
*  Decompress any 'tar.xz' file
*  High compression rate (really similar to 7z)
*  No need to download any extra tool (on macOS)

**Bug:**
When you compress multiple files into one and then you try to decompress the file, you get a  few folders and inside them the compress files, instead of just the compressed files/ folders.
